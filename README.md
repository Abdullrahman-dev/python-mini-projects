# python-mini-projects🧩 Python Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects (mini-programs) designed to practice and demonstrate basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and user input handling.

🧠 Included Projects

🔢 Odd or Even Checker
A simple program that checks whether the entered number is odd or even, with a validation message if the user enters 0 or 1.

👤 Human Object (OOP Example)
A basic example of Object-Oriented Programming, where a Human class is created with a name and age, and the object is printed in a formatted way.

🧮 Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that supports the following operations:
➕ Addition | ➖ Subtraction | ✖️ Multiplication | ➗ Division
The user can enter numbers one by one and type -1 to stop.
Helper functions (sub, mul, div) handle each specific operation.

🎯 Guess the Number Game
A fun number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 10, and the user tries to guess it.
A hint is provided if the guess is very close to the correct number.

🔐 Random Password Generator
A password generator that allows the user to choose the length and types of characters (numbers, letters, or special symbols).
It generates a random secure password based on the selected options.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

random module (for random number and character generation)

string module (for character and symbol handling)

🚀 How to Run

Uncomment any function call at the end of the script to test it, for example:

# numberIsOddOrEvene()
# humanObject("Abdulrahman", 21)
# calculate()
# guessTheNum()
# randomPassword()
